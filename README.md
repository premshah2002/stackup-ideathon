## Proposed Features

### 1. Dark Mode
**Description:**
Dark Mode is one of the most requested features by our community. It is frequently asked about on Discord, highlighting a strong demand.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces eye strain in low-light conditions.
- Enhances visual ergonomics by reducing blue light exposure.

### 2. Project Showcase
**Description:**
Create a dedicated page where Stackies can showcase their projects, including those developed for bounties. Other stackies can comment for feedback and suggestions. Later can be developed for a community project voting.

**Benefits:**
- Encourages sharing and collaboration within the community.
- Provides valuable feedback to project creators.
- Acts as a portfolio for developers, enhancing visibility to potential recruiters.
- Fosters a sense of community by celebrating Stackie achievements.

### 3. Achievements
**Description:**
Introduce badges and certificates to recognize and reward Stackies for their accomplishments. Integration with platforms like [Holopin](https://holopin.io/) and [Credly](https://info.credly.com/) can provide digital badges.

**Benefits:**
- Increases user engagement and motivation.
- Recognizes and rewards community contributions and achievements.
- Enhances profiles with verifiable credentials, boosting career opportunities.

### 4. Coding Challenges
**Description:**
Conduct monthly coding challenges focused on interview preparation. These challenges will test and enhance the skills and knowledge of Stackies, and most importantly they will get to know about where they need to practice more. Platforms like HackerRank are great for such contests. Also StackUp can partner with companies to jointly host the contest and top coders can get prizes or job opportunities.

**Benefits:**
- Provides continuous learning opportunities.
- Encourages healthy competition and skill improvement.
- Keeps the community engaged with regular, fresh content.
- Identifies and showcases top talent within the community.

### 5. Bounty Leaderboard
**Description:**
Introduce a bounty leaderboard where users can see who has submitted the most bounties and who has received the most rewards. This feature will include filtering options.

**Benefits:**
- Increases visibility of top contributors.
- Provides a competitive edge, encouraging more participation.
- Acts as a tool for recruiters to identify and approach top talent.
- Promotes transparency and recognition of efforts within the community.

### 6. Unique Personal Pages for Stackies
**Description:**
Develop unique personal pages for each Stackie, showcasing their stats, projects, and achievements. Users will have the option to make their profiles public or private (idea taked on from qwiklabs).

**Benefits:**
- Enhances visibility of individual accomplishments and projects.
- Provides a platform for users to build and display their personal brand.
- Offers privacy control to users, allowing them to manage their visibility.

## Additional Feature Request

### 7. Quest Visibility Post-Completion
**Description:**
Currently, if a user does not join a quest before it ends, they are unable to view it afterward. Only users who joined the quest, even if they did not submit, can see it. This visibility restriction should be addressed to ensure all users can access and learn from completed quests.

**Benefits:**
- Ensures transparency and inclusivity by allowing all users to access past quests.
- Provides learning opportunities for users who missed the chance to join a quest.
- Allows users to review and learn from past quest submissions and solutions.
- Increases the educational value of the platform by making all content accessible.
